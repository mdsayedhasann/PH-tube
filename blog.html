          <ul class="">
            <li>
              Function-scoped: Variables declared with var are function-scoped,
              meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they
              are defined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their
              containing function or global scope, which means they are moved to
              the top during the compilation phase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mutability: Variables declared with var can be reassigned and
              updated.

          <ul class="">
            <li>
                Block-scoped: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block (typically enclosed by curly braces) in which they are 
            </li>
            <li>
                Hoisting: let declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing block but are not initialized until the actual declaration is encountered in the code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mutability: Variables declared with let can be reassigned, but their values can be changed within the same block.

                      <li>
                        Block-scoped: Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hoisting: const declarations are also hoisted to the top of their containing block but, like let, are not initialized until the actual declaration is encountered.

                      <li>
                        Immutability: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. However, for objects and arrays, their properties or elements can be modified.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized set of rules and principles for building web-based services that enable different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, typically returning data in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are known for their simplicity and are widely used in web development for data exchange and integration.</p>
